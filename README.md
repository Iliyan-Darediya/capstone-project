# movie-matcher
It’s friday night and you are living with roommates or your partner, the popcorn is ready, the blanket is set, the tv is switched on; but what are we watching? At times we just take 20-30 minutes to zero down on a movie. And guess what, by the time the movie is played the popcorn is over, and the mood is no longer craving for a movie

The application is a medium to work on my javascript and database skills. The application will create a React application that will function on Google’s firebase platform. I will develop an algorithm to sort through all the movies selected by all the users and output a single movie. The app will make use of React’s state management property along with context and component.
