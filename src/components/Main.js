            <p className="p-8">The application is a medium to work on my javascript and database skills. The application will create a React application that will function on Google’s firebase platform. I will develop an algorithm to sort through all the movies selected by all the users and output a single movie. The app will make use of React’s state management property along with context and component.</p>
